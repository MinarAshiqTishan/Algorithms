# Algorithms
 Collection of my implementations of common algorithms
 
 Sorting Algorithms
 
 Each Sorting Algorithm has its own module
 
 The modules are at \Sorts\src directory
 
 The \Sorts directory is a Pycharm project. Import it in a Pycharm workspace should work.
 
 Sorts.py is for profiling the algorithms with some hardcoded inputs
