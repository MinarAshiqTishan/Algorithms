# Algorithms
 Collection of my implementations of common algorithms
 
 Sorting Algorithms
 
 Each Sorting Algorithm has its own module
 
 The modules are at \Algorithms\src_\* directory
 
 The \Algorithms directory is a Pycharm project. Importing it in a Pycharm workspace should work.
 
 profiling_\*.py is for profiling the algorithms with some hardcoded inputs
